========== file: WSCAD2010.TXT =======================

The following files contain the LaTeX macros necessary for you to format 
your paper based on the instructions/measurements in the INSTRUCT.TXT 
attachment in our standard author kit for 8.5 x 11-inch proceedings. 
The files appear in the following order:

wscad2010.sty -- the style file
wscad2010.tex -- the main macro set
wscad2010.bib -- the sample bibliography macros
wscad2010.bst -- the bibliography main macro set
wscad2010.txt -- this file, when printed out, will give you a sample 
of how your paper should look when it's finished. This file is in a 
separate attachment from the first four LaTeX files. Remember to save 
it as a .ps file and strip out any extraneous lines at the top of the 
file to enable successful printing.

Note that both current versions of LaTeX, 2e and 2.09, have the same 
macros -- refer to the start of the latex8.sty file for the opening 
statement for each.
